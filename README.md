# selfdescriptions

All self-descriptions required for the Federated Catalogue in Marispace-X are collected here. The self-descriptions are in a draft phase and are steadily evaluated, updated and extended during the Marispace-X project

The self-descriptions are sorted into the following entities  
- Participants  
- Services  
- Data Resources
- Sensor Data

Each self-description has the three following data files
- SHACL (template of the self-description that can be filled out using the SD Creation Wizard)
- JSON-LD (self-description file created from the SHACL template using the SD Creation Wizard)
- verified JSON-LD (the self-description needs to be verified, "wrapped" into a verifiable )
